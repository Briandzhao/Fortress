# Fortress
January 2020. Java 3D music video project for the song Fortress by Rogue.
The finished music video can be viewed at https://www.instagram.com/p/B8GLsJLnO9y/ 
The video features destructible castle towers that consist of 3D arrays of cube objects. Explosions, flickering colors, and scene changes are all in sync with the song's tempo and transitions.
This project relies heavily on object-oriented programming. All of the towers, cubes, and other objects shown in the video are programmed as child classes of generic 3D object classes. The song events, such as destruction, color changes, and camera movement are all represented as trigger-based classes.
I worked on this from 1/15/2020 to 2/2/2020. All of the code is written in Processing, a Java-based sketchbook software available from https://processing.org/
